> ### STATUS : Developing  ⚠️

### THEME: Health data systems

Understanding the behavior of health-related data is critical to creating public policies related to this area. There are several sources of information with health data: Hospitalizations of the Unified Health System (SUS), traffic accidents, infections/deaths from COVID-19 and dengue. The data contained in these datasets may vary, but generally contains address information, coordinates (latitude and longitude),a category (type of disease, specialty, etc.) and some description.
The proposal is to develop a system of geographic visualization of health-related data using known data sources.

The system must have the following features and requirements:

- [ ] Viewing health data on a map;

- [ ] The data must be displayed on the map with the individual location of each point;

- [ ] Each point on the map should show more information when the user hovers over it;

- [ ] The data should be presented on the map grouped through the use of heat/density map;

- [ ] The map should contain filters to select data by disease type, specialty, region, or by date;

- [ ] Charts with health data: for example, number of cases of illness/accidents/hospitalizations by region or by date;

- [ ] The system should only be accessed by registered users;

- [ ] Each type of dataset on the map must have its own icon to make it easier to identify;
